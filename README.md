# reason-homebridge-rfxcom-blinds

This project is supposed to work along with [homebridge-rfxcom-api](https://github.com/darenju/homebridge-rfxcom-api). It gives a front interface to control your RFXCom blinds.

## Installation

You just need to install this package, then the dependencies will automatically install. After that, a script will run and build the latest version of the interface, then you can start the express server:

```
# Install the package
npm install reason-homebridge-rfxcom-blinds
# … installing and building…
# Run the server
npm run server
```

Once you run the server, the interface is accessible on port 4000 of your machine.
