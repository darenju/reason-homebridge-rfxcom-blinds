# reason-homebridge-rfxcom-blinds

This project is supposed to work along with [homebridge-rfxcom-api](https://github.com/darenju/homebridge-rfxcom-api). It gives a front interface to control your RFXCom blinds.

## Installation

You need to install the package from npm, then build the interface, and eventually run it:

```
# Install the package
npm install reason-homebridge-rfxcom-blinds
# Build
npm run build
# Run the server
npm start
```

Once you run the server, the interface is accessible on port 4000 of your machine.
